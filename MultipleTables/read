Identify Microservices:

Break down the application into microservices based on business functionalities. For example:

Product Microservice: Handles CRUD operations for products.
Category Microservice: Manages categories and their associations with products.
Order Microservice: Manages orders and order-related operations.
User Microservice: Manages user accounts and authentication.
OrderItem Microservice: Manages order items and their associations with orders and products.

These entity classes define the relationships between Product, User, CartItem, Order, and Category. For example:

Each Product belongs to a Category (Many-to-One).
Each User can have multiple Orders (One-to-Many).
Each Order contains multiple OrderItems (One-to-Many).
Each CartItem belongs to a User (Many-to-One).
Each OrderItem belongs to both an Order and a Product (Many-to-One).


Order:

The Order entity represents a single order placed by a user.
It contains information such as the order ID, user who placed the order, and potentially other details like order date, shipping address, total price, etc.
An Order can have multiple OrderItems associated with it, representing the items included in that order.
The Order entity may have additional methods for calculating the total price of the order, updating order status, etc.
OrderItem:

The OrderItem entity represents a single item that was part of an order.
It contains information such as the order item ID, the product that was ordered, quantity, and potentially other details like price at the time of order, discounts, etc.
An OrderItem is associated with a specific Order, indicating which order it belongs to.
The OrderItem entity might have additional methods for calculating the subtotal for that item (quantity * price), updating quantity, etc.
